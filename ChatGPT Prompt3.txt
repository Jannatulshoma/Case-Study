It seems like the file path you provided does not exist on your system. Please make sure to provide the correct file path to the Excel file "ROI-89-A1.xlsx".

You can either provide the correct file path or use a relative file path if the Excel file is located in your working directory. Here's an example of how to read the Excel file using a relative file path:

R
Copy code
# Read the Excel file from the working directory
data <- read_excel("ROI-89-A1.xlsx")
Make sure the Excel file is in the same directory where your R script or R Markdown file is located. If it's in a different directory, you need to specify the correct path relative to your current working directory or provide the full absolute path to the file.

If your Excel file is located in your OneDrive folder, you can access it using the OneDrive path. Here's how you can read the Excel file using the OneDrive path:

R
Copy code
# Read the Excel file from OneDrive
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/janna/OneDrive/Baylor University/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx")
Replace "C:/Users/janna/OneDrive/Baylor University/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx" with the actual path to your Excel file on OneDrive. Make sure to use forward slashes (/) in the file path.
