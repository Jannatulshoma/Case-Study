It seems like you're trying to read an Excel file as if it were a zip file. This error occurs because the read_excel() function from the readxl package expects the path to an Excel file directly, not a zip file.

Try using the correct function to read Excel files:

R
Copy code
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:\\Users\\janna\\OneDrive - Baylor University\\Documents\\ROI-89-A1.xlsx")
This should properly read the Excel file into your R environment.

It seems like there's still an issue with the file path. The error message indicates that R is trying to treat the Excel file as a zip file and unzip it, which is incorrect.

Please make sure that the file path is correct and that you are providing the path to the Excel file itself, not a zip file. Here's the correct way to read the Excel file:

r
Copy code
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/janna/OneDrive - Baylor University/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx")
Ensure that the file path is accurate and that the file exists in the specified location. If the issue persists, there may be other factors affecting the file reading process.
