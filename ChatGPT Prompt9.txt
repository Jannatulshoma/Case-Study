C:/Users/janna/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx make a correlation graph of the column named ITGA1 and PLK1 from sheet3 using Area above 100
ChatGPT
To create a correlation graph of the columns named ITGA1 and PLK1 from sheet3 using data where Area is above 100 in the Excel file "ROI-89-A1.xlsx", you can follow these steps:

Read the Excel file.
Subset the data where the Area is above 100.
Extract the columns ITGA1 and PLK1 from sheet3.
Compute the correlation between ITGA1 and PLK1.
Plot the correlation graph.
Here's the R code to accomplish this:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/janna/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet3")

# Subset the data where Area is above 100
subset_data <- filter(data, Area > 100)

# Extract columns ITGA1 and PLK1
subset_data <- subset_data %>% select(ITGA1, PLK1)

# Compute the correlation between ITGA1 and PLK1
correlation <- cor(subset_data$ITGA1, subset_data$PLK1)

# Plot the correlation graph
ggplot(subset_data, aes(x = ITGA1, y = PLK1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Graph",
       x = "ITGA1",
       y = "PLK1",
       caption = paste("Correlation:", round(correlation, 2)))
This code will read the Excel file, filter the data where Area is above 100, extract the columns ITGA1 and PLK1, compute the correlation between them, and then plot a scatterplot with a linear regression line showing the correlation. Adjust the sheet name and column names as per your actual data.

Error in `select()`:
! Can't subset columns that don't exist.
âœ– Column `ITGA1` doesn't exist.
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

It seems that the columns "ITGA1" and "PLK1" might not exist in the subset of data obtained after filtering. Let's check the column names of the subset_data to ensure that the columns exist and are named correctly. You can do this by adding a line of code before selecting the columns:

r
Copy code
# Check column names
print(colnames(subset_data))
This will print out the column names of the subset_data dataframe. Make sure that the column names are correct and adjust the column names accordingly in the select() function.
