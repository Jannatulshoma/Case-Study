ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's the R code to create a histogram using some sample data:

r
Copy code
# Sample data
data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 25, 30, 30, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50)

# Create a histogram
hist(data, main = "Histogram", xlab = "Values", ylab = "Frequency")
This code will create a histogram with the sample data provided. You can customize the main title and axis labels as needed.

C:/Users/janna/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx give me the R code to make a histogram 
ChatGPT
To create a histogram from the data in the Excel file "ROI-89-A1.xlsx", you can use the readxl package to read the data and then create a histogram. Here's the R code:

r
Copy code
# Load the readxl package for reading Excel files
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/janna/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx")

# Assuming the data is in a column named "Values"
# Create a histogram
hist(data$Values, main = "Histogram of Values", xlab = "Values", ylab = "Frequency")
Replace "Values" with the actual column name in your Excel file that contains the data you want to plot. This code will read the Excel file and create a histogram based on the specified column.

C:/Users/janna/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx give me an R code  extract the areas above 100 from the area column in this data set
ChatGPT
To extract the areas above 100 from the "area" column in the Excel file "ROI-89-A1.xlsx", you can use the readxl package to read the data and then subset the data based on the condition. Here's the R code:

r
Copy code
# Load the readxl package for reading Excel files
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/janna/Documents/ROI-89-A1.xlsx")

# Extract areas above 100
areas_above_100 <- subset(data, area > 100)

# View the extracted data
View(areas_above_100)
This code will read the Excel file, extract the rows where the "area" column value is above 100, and then display the extracted data. Adjust the column name ("area") and file path as necessary.
