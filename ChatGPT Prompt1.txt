How do I give you data to run a relative frequency distribution analysis in R
ChatGPT
You can provide the data either by typing it directly into R or by importing it from an external file. Here's how you can do both:

Typing Data Directly into R:
If your data is small, you can type it directly into R. For example, if you have a vector of numerical values:

R
Copy code
# Sample data (vector)
data <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
Importing Data from an External File:
If your data is large or stored in a file (e.g., CSV, Excel), you can import it into R. Here's how you can import a CSV file using the read.csv() function:

R
Copy code
# Read data from a CSV file
data <- read.csv("path/to/your/file.csv")
Replace "path/to/your/file.csv" with the actual file path where your CSV file is located.

Once you have your data loaded into R, you can proceed with your relative frequency distribution analysis. If you need further assistance with the analysis, feel free to ask!
